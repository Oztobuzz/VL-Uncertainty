Use descriptive language that a blind person can understand (e.g., \"lines going up,\" \"two circles connected by a line,\" \"people standing in a group\").\n* Relationship to the question: Explain how the image visually relates to what the question is asking.\n\nKeep the description concise to save time, but ensure it is informative enough.
